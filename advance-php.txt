                           MODULE – 4(Advance PHP)

• What Is Object Oriented Programming?
-> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.

• What Are Properties Of Object Oriented Systems?
-> Abstraction: The process of extracting the properties and behavior of real world objects and representing them in software. Encapsulation: Combining data and methods as one entity.

• What Is Difference Between Class And Interface? 
-> A class can inherit another class. An Interface cannot inherit a class. A class can be inherited by another class using the keyword 'extends'. An Interface can be inherited by a class using the keyword 'implements' and it can be inherited by another interface using the keyword 'extends'.

• What Is Overloading? 
-> Overloading in PHP provides means to dynamically create properties and methods. These dynamic entities are processed via magic methods one can establish in a class for various action types.

• What are the differences between abstract classes and interfaces? 
-> Interface: Explore the Difference between Abstract Class and Interface in Java. The Abstract class and Interface both are used to have abstraction. An abstract class contains an abstract keyword on the declaration whereas an Interface is a sketch that is used to implement a class.

• Define Constructor and Destructor? 
-> Constructors: Constructors are called when an object is created from a class. Destructors: Destructors are called when an object destructs. Usually, it is when the script ends.

• How to Load Classes in PHP? 
-> PHP load classes are used for declaring its object etc. in object oriented applications. PHP parser loads it automatically, if it is registered with spl_autoload_register() function. PHP parser gets the least chance to load class/interface before emitting an error.

• How to Call Parent Constructor?
-> In order to run a parent constructor, a call to parent::__construct() within the child constructor is required. If the child does not define a constructor then it may be inherited from the parent class just like a normal class method (if it was not declared as private).

• Write PHP Script of Object Iteration?
-> PHP provides a way for objects to be defined so it is possible to iterate through a list of items, with, for example a foreach statement. By default, all visible properties will be used for the iteration.

• Use of The $this keyword ?
-> The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name (because a class attribute is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter).


• What is jQuery?
-> jQuery is a fast, small, cross-platform and feature-rich JavaScript library. It is designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, animation, event handling, and AJAX very simple with an easy-to-use API that works on a lot of different type of browsers.

• How are JavaScript and jQuery different?
What is difference between JavaScript and jQuery w3schools?
jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

• Which is the starting point of code execution in jQuery?
->The jQuery starts its code execution from the $(document).ready() function which is executed whenever the whole HTML DOM is loaded and is totally rendered by the browser, so that the event handlers work correctly without any errors. This $(document).ready() function load the script only after the whole DOM is loaded by the browser.

• What is the difference between prop and attr?
->prop() method provides a way to explicitly retrieve property values, while . attr() retrieves attributes.

• Explain Difference Between JQuery And JavaScript?
->JavaScript is a high-level interpreted scripting language for composing client-side applications. It is a combination of ECMA script as well as Document Object Model (DOM). JQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library. It only contains the DOM.

• How We Can Implement Animation Effects In Jquery?
->jQuery Animations - The animate() Method
The jQuery animate() method is used to create custom animations. Syntax: $(selector).animate({params},speed,callback); The required params parameter defines the CSS properties to be animated.

• Apply jQuery validation using library.
->first,add jQuery library in your file. Then to define rules use simple syntax. jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery("#forms).validate({ rules: { firstname: 'required', lastname: 'required', u_email: { required: true, email: true,//add an email rule that will ensure the value entered is valid email id.

• Create custom dynamic function for require field validator.

Step 2: Create the basic structure of the image preview. ...
Step 3: Create a place to preview the image. ...
Step 4: Create input boxes and buttons. ...
Step 5: Activate Image Upload with JavaScript code.
